                                                    <p>Falls are the most common cause of injury-related emergency department (ED) visits in older adults. Falls are also the leading cause of injury-related death in this population. Falls in the home are particularly dangerous because they often occur in private and out of sight of others. Undetected falls can have serious consequences, including broken bones, head injuries, and even death. According to the National Falls Survey , an estimated 27% of older adults in the United States experience a fall each year. This percentage increases to 41% for those over the age of 80. Falls are also a major source of injury-related hospitalizations among older adults; they account for more than one-third of all injury-related hospitalizations among people in this age group. Falls can be prevented with some simple strategies that can be put into practice even in a small home. Here are some ideas for how to reduce the risk of falls in your home:</p><h2>Install grab bars in the bathroom and near the tub or shower</h2><p>Grab bars can be placed in the bathroom to assist with getting in and out of the tub or shower, as well as while sitting on the toilet. They are especially important for people who have impaired mobility or poor balance, as well as anyone who lives alone and has limited access to assistance.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that you install grab bars in the following locations: - Toilet: The toilet seat should be 16 inches above the floor. The toilet bowl should be 12 inches deep. - Shower: The shower floor should be 36 inches above the floor. The shower wall should be 36 inches high. - Bathtub: The tub should be 18 inches deep. Place grab bars on both sides of the tub and between the tub and the wall. - Toilet and Shower: Place grab bars in the entryway to assist with moving from the toilet to the shower. Place grab bars in the bathroom on either side of the toilet and shower to assist with moving between those areas.</p><h2>Install a stair rail in the home’s main entryway</h2><p>A stair rail can be placed in the home’s main entryway, where the risk of falling is highest. A stair rail can help stabilize you as you walk up and down the stairs and can prevent you from falling if you lose your balance. The National Institute on Aging recommends that you install a stair rail in the following locations: - Stairs: Place a stair rail on both sides of each flight of stairs. - Balcony: Place a stair rail on the landing between the staircase and the balcony. - Basement: Place a stair rail at the top and bottom of the stairs leading to the basement.</p><h2>Install a door stop in the kitchen</h2><p>A door stop can be placed in the kitchen to help reduce the risk of injury from bumping into the door while carrying a heavy object or while reaching for a high cabinet. The National Institute on Aging recommends placing a door stop in the following locations: - The top of the door frame where the door meets the floor. - The bottom of the door frame where the door meets the floor. - The top of the door frame where the door meets the wall. - The bottom of the door frame where the door meets the wall.</p><h2>Install grab bars in the kitchen and other high-risk areas</h2><p>Grab bars can be placed in the kitchen and other high-risk areas of the home, such as near the fridge and stove, to provide support and help prevent falls. The National Institute on Aging recommends that you place grab bars in the kitchen in the following locations: - The top of the counter where the counter meets the wall. - The top of the kitchen cabinets where the counter meets the cabinets. - The bottom of the kitchen cabinets where the counter meets the cabinets.</p><h2>Install non-skid flooring in high-risk areas</h2><p>Non-skid flooring can be placed in the kitchen and other high-risk areas of the home, such as near the fridge and stove, to help prevent falls. The National Institute on Aging recommends that you install non-skid flooring in the kitchen in the following locations: - The top of the counter where the counter meets the wall. - The top of the kitchen cabinets where the counter meets the cabinets. - The bottom of the kitchen cabinets where the counter meets the cabinets.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Falls are a common and preventable cause of injury-related emergency department (ED) visits in older adults. Falls in the home are particularly dangerous because they often occur in private and out of sight of others. Undetected falls can have serious consequences, including broken bones, head injuries, and even death. Falls can be prevented with some simple strategies that can be put into practice even in a small home. Here are some ideas for how to reduce the risk of falls in your home.</p>
