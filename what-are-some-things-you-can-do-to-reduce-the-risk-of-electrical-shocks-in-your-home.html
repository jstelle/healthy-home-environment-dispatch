                                                    <p>Electricity can be a dangerous thing in an incorrect home installation. While most older homes have adequate wiring and protection, new construction may not. Electrical shocks can result when unqualified electricians connect new appliances or wires without taking safety precautions. The National Electrical Safety Foundation estimates that 600 people die each year from electrical-related injuries, but that number is likely much higher since many incidents go unreported. Fortunately, there are ways to reduce your risk of an electrical shock in your home. Keep reading for more information about how to protect yourself and your loved ones from this serious hazard.</p><h2>Understand the hazards of electricity</h2><p>Before you begin any electrical work in your home, you need to understand the hazards associated with electricity. This will help you make informed decisions about what materials to use and how to install them properly. You should also be aware of any conditions that could increase your risk of an electrical shock. These include working on an unfinished basement, repairing an outdoor lighting system, or doing any work near water that could cause a short circuit.Working near water or in an unfinished basement can increase the risk of an electrical shock because those areas are less likely to have the proper protective wiring installed. Outdoor lighting systems are also a common source of electrical hazards because they may be installed without the proper protection.You should also be careful when working in the attic of your home, since that is a common location for exposed wiring. It’s best to hire a professional to inspect any attic spaces in your home before you begin any electrical work.</p><h2>Properly ground new appliances and fixtures</h2><p>One of the most common sources of an electrical shock is when you plug a new appliance or lighting fixture into an outlet without first grounding it. This is when the metal plug on the appliance or light touches the outlet’s metal or plastic casing. When you plug in, the appliance or light creates a temporary electrical connection between the two.To reduce the risk of an electrical shock, you should always ground any new appliances or fixtures. This involves connecting the appliance or light to the ground wires inside the outlet. You can do this by plugging in a small grounding wire. You can also find grounding wires that are built into some appliances and fixtures.</p><h2>Install GFCI Outlets and Breakers</h2><p>A GFCI breaker or outlet is an important safety device that can help prevent electrical shocks. GFCI breakers and outlets are required in areas of the home that may come into contact with water, like the kitchen and bathroom. GFCI breakers and outlets are also useful in outdoor areas that may come into contact with rainwater.Anytime you’re working on an area that comes into contact with water, it’s important to turn the GFCI breaker or outlet off and then back on once you’re finished. This will help prevent the water from creating a short circuit and causing an electrical hazard.You can also purchase GFCI breakers and outlets for your home’s main electrical panel. These are important safety devices that are required in all areas of the home, including the garage and basement.</p><h2>Watch for signs of an electrical hazard</h2><p>It’s important to keep an eye out for signs of an electrical hazard while you’re working on your home. This will help you identify and fix any issues before they become a hazard.One of the most common signs of an electrical hazard is erratic voltage. You can tell if your home is experiencing erratic voltage by using a voltage tester. You can purchase a basic tester for a few dollars at most hardware stores.Another common sign of an electrical hazard is a flickering light. If you have a light that suddenly begins to flicker, it’s likely the result of an electrical problem. You should shut off the breaker to the light and then contact a professional.You should also be aware of any electrical noise or humming in your home. This is a sign that the wires in your home may be overloaded. You should shut off the breaker to the wires and then contact a professional.</p><h2>Watch out for extension cords and appliances with frayed wires</h2><p>You should also be aware of the condition of any extension cords you use in your home. It’s important to regularly inspect any extension cords you use in your home to make sure they are in good condition.You should also be aware of the condition of any appliances you use in your home. Appliances with frayed wires or exposed wiring can create an electrical hazard. You should always unplug appliances before you begin any electrical work to avoid a dangerous situation.If you notice that a plug or cord is frayed or worn, replace it immediately. You should also be careful when working with appliances and wires that are frayed or worn. You should unplug the appliance before you begin any work and then replace the plug once you’re finished.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Electricity can be a dangerous thing in an incorrect home installation. While most older homes have adequate wiring and protection, new construction may not. Electrical shocks can result when unqualified electricians connect new appliances or wires without taking safety precautions.
